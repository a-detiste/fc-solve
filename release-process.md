Releasing a new version of the core Freecell Solver code is quite involved,
so I am documenting it here.

Update `ver.txt` , `NEWS.asciidoc` , and the version number in `README.asciidoc` .

See [fc-solve/scripts/mint-new-release.bash](fc-solve/scripts/mint-new-release.bash) .

`git tag freecell-solver-6.4.0` (or similar).
